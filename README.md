# ONT_PolishDraftAndQC

This repository contains a workflow for polishing draft assemblies generated from Oxford Nanopore reads with Dorado.

## Dev Dependencies

- [uv](https://astral.sh/uv)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net)

## Setup dev environment

To get this all set up and groovy, simply ensure you have the dependencies listed above and execute `./dev_env/dev_setup.sh`

Which does the following:

1. creates a virtual environment using uv
2. installs dev_deps.txt using uv.
   contents:
    - [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to check files using the following linters at time before commit.
    - [miniwdl](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl) for linting and checking wdl files. (needs shellcheck)
    - [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) for linting and checking yaml files.
3. installs pre-commit to this repository.

Activate the virtual environment and you're good to go.
>protip: I have these handy aliases in my .bashrc:
>
> - `alias uva="source .venv/bin/activate"`
> - `alias uvd="deactivate"`
> - `alias uvi="uv pip install"`

## Managing Tags and Versions

for versioning this workflow, be sure to change your version in `.VERSION` and use `make tag` to create and push the tag.

Manage versions for your containers in their respective makefiles.

## Running miniwdl check without committing changes

just use `make check` and both miniwdl and yamllint will run on every `*.wdl` and `*.yaml/yml` file in the project.
